# 2D Array Playground

Create a small program to put the topics you have learned into code 😄

This should be a little playground to cover different approaches of iterating and modifying multidimensional arrays.

## Objective

In this exercise, you need to cover a few features to implement, like:

- **Dynamic grid sizes**  
  Let the user select how many rows and columns should be created.

- **Fill the grid with values**  
  You can either use random symbols or let the user decide how to fill values — be creative! 😄

- **Print the content of the grid**

- **Modify specific ranges**  
  Try to:
  - Mark the cells of the grid like a chessboard (alternating cells are marked), or
  - Display the border of the grid.

## Example Output

### 3×3 Grid with Indices and Borders

```
[0,0] | [0,1] | [0,2]
---------------------
[1,0] | [1,1] | [1,2]
---------------------
[2,0] | [2,1] | [2,2]
```

### 8×8 Chessboard Pattern

## 🎨 Added Fun

Check out the [Colorful.Console NuGet package](https://github.com/tomakita/Colorful.Console?tab=readme-ov-file)  
to color the output on the console! You can display different rows/columns/numbers/symbols in multiple colors 🌈
